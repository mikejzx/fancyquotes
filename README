fancyquotes
===========

https://github.com/mikejzx/fancyquotes.git

This is a simple utility for converting standard quotation marks (and
apostrophes) to "typographer's quotes".

fancyquotes is intended to be used as a post-processer for roff documents. The
code can be easily modified to replace with unicode quotes too. (May add an
option in future).

USAGE:

  fancyquotes <filename>

fancyquotes can also read from standard input, e.g.:

  echo "Hello" | fancyquotes


EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Shown below are some examples of output produced by fancyquotes.

  These are 'single quotes', and these are "double quotes"
    becomes
  These are \[oq]single quotes\[cq], and these are \[lq]double quotes\[rq].

  We'd, it's, you'd, 'till, 'cause, etc.
    becomes
  We\[cq]d, it\[cq]s, you\[cq]d, \[oq]till, \[oq]cause, etc.

NOTE: since this is designed for roff documents, line which are macros
themselves will be left unchanged. For example, lines such as the following
will be ignored:
  .B "This is a test"
  .IP "You'd have to manually change these if you want fancy quotes"

LIMITATIONS:
* Currently, fancyquotes only works on files with lines that are shorter than
  1024 bytes in length! This still needs to be fixed.
