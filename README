fancyquotes
===========

https://github.com/mikejzx/fancyquotes.git

This is a simple utility for converting standard quotation marks (and
apostrophes) to "typographer's quotes". This program was originally intended as
a postprocessor for roff documents.

USAGE:

  fancyquotes [OPTION] <filename>

fancyquotes can also read from standard input, e.g.:

  echo "Hello" | fancyquotes

OPTIONS:

      --help     show help info.

  -u, --unicode  replace with unicode quotes (default)

  -r, --roff     process for use with roff documents.

  -c, --clever   (roff mode only) attempts to preserve quotes in roff macros
                 (use this if running on whole roff documents).

  -h, --html     replace with HTML quotes.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Shown below are some examples of output produced by fancyquotes (in roff mode)

  These are 'single quotes', and these are "double quotes"
    becomes
  These are \[oq]single quotes\[cq], and these are \[lq]double quotes\[rq].

  We'd, it's, you'd, 'till, 'cause, etc.
    becomes
  We\[cq]d, it\[cq]s, you\[cq]d, \[oq]till, \[oq]cause, etc.

"Clever mode" in roff:
Passing --clever or -c will make fancyquotes work a little better on whole roff
documents, by leaving lines beginning with macros unchanged, e.g.:
  .B "This is a test"
  .IP "You'd have to manually change these if you want fancy quotes"
Currently this does not work with preprocessors such as EQN or TBL, so keep
that in mind! (May add functionality in future)
