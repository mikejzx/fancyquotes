fancyquotes
===========

https://github.com/mikejzx/fancyquotes.git

This is a simple utility for converting standard quotation marks (and
apostrophes) to "typographer's quotes". This program was originally intended as
a postprocessor for roff documents and thus has some features specific to roff.

USAGE:

  fancyquotes [OPTION] <filename>

fancyquotes can also read from standard input, e.g.:

  echo "Hello" | fancyquotes

OPTIONS:

      --help     show help info.

  -u, --unicode  replace with unicode quotes (default)

  -r, --roff     process for use with roff documents.

  -c, --clever   (roff mode only) attempts to preserve quotes in roff macros
                 (use this if running on whole roff documents).

  -h, --html     replace with HTML quotes.


EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Shown below are some examples of output produced by fancyquotes (in roff mode)

  These are 'single quotes', and these are "double quotes"
    becomes
  These are \[oq]single quotes\[cq], and these are \[lq]double quotes\[rq].

  We'd, it's, you'd, 'till, 'cause, etc.
    becomes
  We\[cq]d, it\[cq]s, you\[cq]d, \[oq]till, \[oq]cause, etc.

"Clever" mode (for roff documents):
Passing --clever or -c will make fancyquotes work a little better on whole roff
(designed for ms macros) documents, by leaving lines beginning with macros
unchanged, e.g.:

  .B "This is a test"
  .IP "You'd have to manually change these if you want fancy quotes"

Also, text which are in preprocessor blocks (.TS, .TE, .PS, .PE, etc.) are left
unchanged. This is to prevent screwing up important quotes in tbl settings, and
quotes for mathematical equations in eqn.
  The implementation is fairly basic at the moment, so please open an issue if
you encounter any bugs.
